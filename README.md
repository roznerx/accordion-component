# "Build an Accordion component" for the "React Practice Calendar" challenge by reactpractice.dev 

Made by **roznerx** (ignaciorosner@gmail.com)

- Second day of the calendar, this time doing an Accordion component from scratch
- Again, plain and simple React, as requested in the challenge; logic is super easy
- Didn't bother with branching this time as it is a little project and this doesn't need to demonstrate my knowledge in Git...
- ... That being said, the examples in the exercise's page show a GitHub FAQ mock, so I might create another branch to do so

**NOTE:** exercise didn't specify if multiple items could be opened at the same time, so I went for allowing to open just a single one; might refactor this according to the GitHub mock!
